        there\r\n\r\nI''ve fixed a bug which has a crash.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bug is occured
        on creating image tag if passing NULL value to link on `rndr_image`.\r\n\r\nFor
        example:\r\n\r\n- OK: `![](a)` \r\n- NG: `![]()`\r\n\r\nHappened the crash
        because passing `link` value is not checked to use.\r\n\r\nSo, I added `if
        (link && link->size)`. (See 486 Lines)\r\n\r\nAnd, I formatted brace. (See
        496 Lines)\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n(I did noticed what there are no tests
        about image.

        file was a bit  messy, it is now much more clear.\r\n\r\nMoreover, at the
        moment, we are writing the output to `STDOUT`. Even though that''s pretty
        easy to rely on `>>` inside the command line to write it to a file instead,
        it becomes a bit harder dealing with multiples files. For the sake of backward-compatibility,
